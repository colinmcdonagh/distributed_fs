// Specification
/*
 organiser needs to keep track of file server addresses,
 and what server is due to be uploaded to next.

 Also needs to keep track of which file path corresponds to
 which server.
*/

// Assumptions
/*
 an assumption that will be made is that file servers won't be
 able to be added after the original addresses are specified when
 starting up the organiser.

 there is only one organiser.

 a proxy that requests to upload a file will do so, with the
 given local filename specified in the upload server address request.

 can only set local filename when creating the file. After that, would
 have to introduce some sort of remove file command implemented by
 the file servers.
